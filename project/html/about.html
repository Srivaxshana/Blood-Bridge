                but recover with rest and hydration.
            </li>

                Some may experience mild discomfort in the arm.

        <p>
            During the donation, the process is quick and simple, ensuring your comfort while 
            collecting the blood needed to help others.
            <br /><br />
            For a whole blood donation procedure:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Registration – The donor provides personal details and completes a health questionnaire.</li>

            <li> Blood Collection – A sterile needle is inserted into a vein, and about 350-450 ml of blood is collected in a bag. The process takes 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Relaxation – After donation, the needle is removed, and a bandage is applied to the site. The donor rests for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Refreshments – Donors are given fluids and light snacks to help regain energy.</li>

        <h2 class="title">What to know before you donate</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Before donating blood, it's important to be aware of certain guidelines and prepare properly to ensure a safe and successful donation.</p>
